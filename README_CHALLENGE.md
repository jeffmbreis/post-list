 Task: Build a Simple Next.js Application

You are required to create a simple Next.js application that fetches data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly manner. 


#### The application should include the following features:

1.  Fetch Data: Use the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API to fetch a list of posts.
2.  Display Data: Render the list of posts on the homepage, showing the title and a brief excerpt of each post.
3.  TypeScript: Implement the application using TypeScript to ensure type safety.
4.  Styling: Use Tailwind CSS for styling the application to make it visually appealing.

#### Requirements

*   The application should be built using Next.js and TypeScript.
*   Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
*   Ensure the application is responsive and performs well.
*   The code should be clean, maintainable, and follow best practices.

#### Constraints

*   You have 30 - 40  minutes to complete this challenge.
*   You can use any online code editor that supports Next.js and TypeScript (e.g., [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/)).
*   You may not use any backend services or databases; all data should be fetched from the provided public API.
